                    <span class="cat">About Me</span>
                    <p>Growing up, complex systems on the cutting edge of computer science always exhilarated me.
                        Curious about the next big thing in tech conferences such as the Consumer Electronics Show, I
                        constantly fed my curiosity by watching instructional videos and reading articles on code
                        applications such as interpolation of low frame footage and AI learning how to play chess. I was
                        introduced to computer science in high school competitive robotics, which brought me pure joy
                        and excitement from seeing the robot move precisely according to my commands.</p>
                    <p>This passion and hunger for knowledge have brought me to college as a first-generation college
                        student. I grew a passion and a sense of belonging for coding when I took on more projects and
                        saw the impact on colleagues and teammates, making me wonder about the potential impact I could
                        make if I learned more. My responsibility from that point on has become to benefit humanity with
                        the knowledge acquired throughout my educational career and the years to come. With my
                        enthusiasm for computer science and machine learning, this philosophy has drawn me to the
                        potential future with automation and its democratization to the general public.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Established a general workflow that compares the genetic homology of two
                            plant species using R</li>
                        <li>Analyzed data-set of two plant species to determine microbial interactions of
                            a fungi via dimensionalreduction using an R package called ”Seurat”.</li>
                        <li>Automated a pipeline for creating genome references, trimming data, and
                                mapping it via an R package called ”Drake”</li>

                    <p>The following are generated by an AI with VQGAN + CLIP by Max Woolf. This interests me because of
                        the idea that I could put any artist name as well as a particular object and is able to do so
                        with ease via generation from Google Colab</p>
