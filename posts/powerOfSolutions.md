In his thought-provoking anecdotes, Nassim Taleb illustrated the paradox of "obvious" solutions. He highlighted how the wheel and the suitcase, two seemingly complementary inventions, existed independently for centuries before someone thought to combine them. This simple yet powerful combination revolutionized travel, underscoring the transformative potential of "obvious" solutions.

A similar missed opportunity occurred in the Incan Empire. While Incan children played with toys featuring wheels, the adults never thought to apply this technology for practical purposes. The wheel, a tool that could have significantly facilitated transportation and labor, was instead relegated to the realm of play.

Such stories should invoke not only a sense of regret but also a sense of inspiration. They hint at the multitude of "obvious" technological improvements that could significantly enhance our lives. However, these improvements remain unrealized, often overshadowed by the development of complex and inefficient technologies.

This phenomenon is particularly apparent in the realm of web development. During the 90s, as the internet was rapidly evolving, web developers transitioned from manual HTML editing to complex proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web frameworks. These tools, while powerful, regenerate web pages with every visit, leading to a computationally intensive process.

In the rush to adopt these new tools, the industry overlooked a simpler solution: static site generators. Unlike dynamic web frameworks, static site generators create web pages once when the content changes rather than on every visit. This approach leads to faster loading times, less server load, and a more efficient overall process.

The failure to consider this "obvious" solution has had lasting consequences. Today's web is often slow-loading and minimal in content, bogged down by the computational overhead of dynamic web frameworks. Moreover, the culture of web developers has evolved in a peculiar direction, with many developers adhering to practices (referred to as 'anti-patterns') that go against best design principles.

These examples illustrate the importance of considering "obvious" solutions in technology development. While the allure of complexity and novelty can be enticing, sometimes the most impactful innovations are the ones hiding in plain sight. As we continue to push the boundaries of technology, we should remember to look for the simple, elegant solutions that might be right under our noses.

## The Missed Opportunity of Bitcoin

In a recent panel discussion at the World Transport Convention, leaders from the Hyperloop Future team sparked a debate on "obvious solutions" in the realm of transportation. The modern railroad system, with its inherent inefficiencies and extensive infrastructure, relies on steel-on-steel friction to propel trains while maintaining a certain level of speed and safety. However, this system can be seen as an overly complex and inefficient solution. It necessitates a vast, intricate network of tracks and signalling systems to maintain a "safe network."

The idea that traditional railway systems are the only viable means of ground transportation is being challenged. Alternatives, such as magnetic levitation (maglev) trains, have been proposed and even implemented in some parts of the world. Yet, the long-term implications and scalability of maglev technology remain controversial due to high construction and maintenance costs, as well as energy consumption considerations. From an outsider's perspective, our struggle with modernizing ground transportation might look as perplexing as the Incas' failure to use wheels for practical applications.

Despite these challenges, it is crucial to remember that our current transportation paradigms are not immutable. Just as the wheel was eventually placed on the suitcase, leading to a revolution in personal travel, so too might we witness a drastic shift in how we approach large-scale ground transportation. As we continue to explore and innovate, we should remain open to the possibility that the most "obvious" solution could be the most revolutionary.

## Takeaways

Reflecting on these case studies, we can derive several important insights:

1. The most transformative technological advancements often come from obvious solutions hiding in plain sight.
2. It is a fallacy to dismiss simple and apparent solutions with the rationale that "if it were a good idea, someone else would have already done it."
3. We must always strive for simplicity and elegance in technology, avoiding the trap of unnecessarily complex solutions when simpler alternatives are available.

As we advance and innovate, constantly challenging our preconceived notions and assumptions is critical. We should not underestimate the potential of "obvious" solutions, which may very well lead to the most revolutionary changes in our technological landscape.
